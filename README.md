Hi, I'm Xavier, I really like working with data, performance, good development practices and also disseminating knowledge, in this way, everyone wins.
My focus is supporting the development team with database operations, improvement opportunities, performance, dictionary of data, summarized data actuator, data processing in general.
Since the beginning of my career, comes two roles, such as DBA as a developer, resulting in 10 years of knowledge gained in these two roles, which brings significant support to development teams.
